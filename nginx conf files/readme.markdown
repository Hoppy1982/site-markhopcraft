# nginx conf files

*These are the nginx config files used to setup nginx on port 80 as a reverse proxy server with my node servers running behind that. Including them in this repo in case I balls things up at some point in the future. Their paths are as follows:*

* etc/nginx/nginx.conf
* etc/nginx/proxy_params
* etc/nginx/sites-available

*nginx.conf is the main dude and references all the other configs by way of includes.*
